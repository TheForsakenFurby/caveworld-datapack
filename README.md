# ABOUT

Can you beat the Ender Dragon without visiting the surface? Furby's Caveworld is a mediocre data pack that makes it so that your survival experience starts and stays underground.
The overworld is ~120 blocks tall and made up entirely of caves and underground structures, clamped between a bedrock floor and a bedrock ceiling.
All that space is covered by lush caves, dripstone caves, or the deep dark.

There are several gameplay tweaks too, but the pack is intended to give a very "vanilla-like" experience.
This data pack was designed to be a one-time experience, rather than a staple for all of your future survival worlds.
(That would get dull, as most vanilla content is completely inaccessible.)

All custom content is written in English. There are no translations, sorry. (I am NOT accepting translation offers: implementing translations would require me to ship a resource pack alongside this, probably as a mod, which I don't want to deal with.)

If you have any questions, feedback, or want guidance on how the heck you do something, feel free to message me on Discord @theforsakenfurby

# HOW TO ENABLE !

The current version of Furby's Caveworld was made for Minecraft Java Edition 1.21.10. There is a good chance that it does NOT get updated for future versions. I cannot guarantee comptability with any mods or other data packs.

Because this is a data pack rather than a mod, you do not need a special launcher. It will work in the default launcher.

The data pack will only work if you **enable it during world creation:** In the world creation menu, click the More tab, then the Data Packs button.
Drag and drop the zip file onto your game window to add it to this world's Available data packs. Then, hover over the icon of me in a cave, and click the arrow to move Furby's Caveworld over to the Selected column. Make sure that Furby's Caveworld is somewhere above the default data for Minecraft in the Selected column, or the pack won't work.
Finally, click Done, configure any gamerules you may want to (though a few will get overwritten), and create the world.

The game will give you two warnings about experimental features. This is unavoidable and not a problem — it just means that the pack is likely to break in future versions.

# KNOWN ISSUE

* Cave carvers and ravines go up 1 block higher than they should, leaving ugly, patchy bedrock in the ceiling. I do not know what causes this. Moving their maximum possible starting height down by one block did not fix it.

# VERSION INFORMATION FOR NERDS
(Newest to Oldest)

* v1.0.0 — Full release. For Java Edition 1.21.10. Versioning is now standard. 
* v0.1.0 ("SBEVE") — Beta release?  For Java Edition 1.21.4. This single version was refered to as "vSBEVE-1", "v. SBEVE.1", and other such designations in several different places. I'm retroactively assigning it v0.1.0 because it probably can't be upgraded safely. I shared this release in a private Discord server. "SBEVE Beta" has multiple significant issues and I believe it to be worse than v1.0.0 in every conceivable way.

From v1.0.0 on, versioning follows a standard semantic vX.Y.Z. format. Assuming I understood the explanation correctly, this means:
* When Z increases, the update is a "hotfix": bugs have been fixed, but NO new content has been introduced. You can safely upgrade existing worlds to the new version of the data pack.
* When Y increases, new content HAS been introduced. Bugs may have fixed too. You can safely upgrade existing worlds to the new version of the data pack.
* When X increases, changes have been made such that you CANNOT safely upgrade existing worlds to the new version of the data pack without risking corruption, crashes, or other serious issues. Bugs may have been fixed too, and new content may have been added.
