# ABOUT

Can you beat the Ender Dragon without visiting the surface? Furby's Caveworld is a mediocre data pack makes it so that your survival experience starts and stays underground.
The overworld is ~120 blocks tall and made up entirely of caves and underground structures, clamped between a bedrock floor and a bedrock ceiling.
All that space is covered by lush caves, dripstone caves, or the deep dark.

There are several gameplay changes too, but the pack is intended to give a "Vanilla-like" experience.
This data pack was designed to be a one-time experience, rather than a staple for all of your future survival worlds.
(That would get dull, as many vanilla gameplay features are completely inaccessible in this data pack.)

Everything is in US English. There is no language localization. (Even if I wanted to do that it would require a resource pack too and need to be shipped as a mod or something.)

# HOW TO ENABLE !

Furby's Caveworld was made for Minecraft: Java Edition 1.21.4 (though it should also work with 1.21.2, 1.21.3, and most if not all development versions between 24w37a and 1.21.4 Release Candidate 3 (inclusive)).
There is a good chance that it does NOT get updated for future versions. I cannot guarantee comptability with any mods or other data packs.

The data pack will only work if you **enable it during world creation.** In the world creation menu, click the More tab, then the Data Packs button.
Drag and drop the zip file onto your game window to add it to this world's Available data packs. Then, hover over the icon of my face, and click the arrow to move Furby's Caveworld over to the Selected column.
Make sure that the datapack is somewhere above the default data for Minecraft, or it won't work. Finally, click Done, configure any gamerules you may want to, and create the world.
(The game will give you two warnings about experimental features. This is unavoidable and not a problem â€” it just means that the pack is likely to break in future versions.)
